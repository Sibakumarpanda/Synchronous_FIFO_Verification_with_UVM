# Synchronous_FIFO_Verification_with_UVM
# Synchronous FIFO Design and UVM based TB Infra development
# Synchronous FIFO Design Specification Details :
# Data input width = 32 bit, data output width = 32bit 
# Address width = 3, Hence FIFO Depth=2^(address width)= 8
# The width of the write and read pointer = log2(Depth of FIFO)= log2(8)=3bits
# Hence FIFO Memory will be 32x8
